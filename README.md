This repository contains the code, data processing pipeline, and results for the paper:

**"Improving Tropical Cyclone Genesis Detection with Feature Selection and Explainable Artificial Intelligence"**

---

## 📘 Overview

Tropical cyclone genesis (TCG) remains one of the key challenges in climate and weather science. This project introduces a novel machine learning framework—**Spatial Cluster-Optimized Feature Selection (SCO-FS)**—to improve long-term detection and interpretation of cyclone formation using environmental variables and climate indices.

SCO-FS is applied across six major tropical ocean basins and incorporates:
- Spatial clustering to reduce dimensionality,
- Evolutionary optimization for feature selection,
- Neural networks for prediction,
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🌍 Supports **six ocean basins**: North Atlantic, Northeastern Pacific, Northwestern Pacific, North Indian, South Indian, and South Pacific.
- 📊 Incorporates reanalysis data (e.g., ERA5) and climate indices (e.g., ENSO3.4, SOI, PDO).
- ⚙️ Uses **Probabilistic Coral Reef Optimization with Substrate Layers (PCRO-SL)** for robust feature selection.
- 🧠 Neural network models are trained with features selected per basin.
- 🔍 SHAP-based explainability to explore **impacts** of environmental drivers.
