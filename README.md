This repository contains the code, data processing pipeline, and results for the paper:

**"XAI-GPI: An Interpretable and Adaptive Machine Learning Genesis Index for Tropical Cyclones"**

## üìò Overview

Tropical cyclone genesis (TCG) remains one of the key challenges in climate and weather science. This project introduces a machine learning framework to build a novel Genesis Potential Index (GPI) to improve long-term detection and interpretation of cyclone formation using environmental variables and climate indices.

XAI-GPI is tuned on six major tropical ocean basins and is developed following 4 major steps:
- Spatial clustering to reduce dimensionality,
- Evolutionary optimization for feature selection,
- Neural networks for prediction,
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability.

## üß† Key Features

- üåç Supports **six ocean basins**: North Atlantic, Northeastern Pacific, Northwestern Pacific, North Indian, South Indian, and South Pacific.
- üìä Incorporates reanalysis data (e.g., ERA5) and climate indices (e.g., Ni√±o3.4, SOI, PDO).
- ‚öôÔ∏è Uses **Probabilistic Coral Reef Optimization with Substrate Layers (PCRO-SL)** for robust feature selection.
- üß† Neural network models are trained with features selected per basin.
- üîç SHAP-based explainability to explore **impacts** of environmental drivers.

## üåø Branches

- `main`: clean version of the code for consultation (publication version)
- `dev`: full development history and work in progress

Feel free to fork the repo and explore both branches.
Pull requests are welcome via the `dev` branch.
